# ANALYSIS OF BOSTON HOUSING DATASET USING APACHE-SPARK

This project aims to find the factors affecting the domestic property value in the city of Boston. Factors like per capita income,environmental factors, educational facilities, property size, etc were taken into consideration to determine the most significant parameters. We create multiple linear regression model using forward stepwise selection and compare its performance with the linear regression model containing all the variables. We use the following metrics to compare the performance of the models: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Adjusted R-squared value, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). and model Mean Squared Error (MSE).
